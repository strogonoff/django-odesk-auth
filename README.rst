django-odesk-auth
=================

Simple oDesk (now Upwork) login for your Django-based project.

At current version it has inflexible and impossible to disable access control.
It suits my own needs so far but I plan to improve on this, given demand.

Tested with Django 1.6.

**Note: oDesk rebranded as Upwork.**
Version 0.2.0 of this library depends on ``python-upwork`` instead of ``python-odesk``,
and therefore works with new API endpoints.
Further support and development, if any, will only be continued for new
``django-upwork-auth``, which is in the works. (See issue #4.)


Creating oDesk OAuth API key
----------------------------

Go to https://www.odesk.com/services/api/apply.

* Authentication type should be set to "OAuth 1.0".
* Callback URL should be left blank.
* Permission "View the structure of your companies/teams" is currently
  required to be checked.


Quick start
-----------

Provided you have installed ``django-odesk-auth`` and ``python-upwork==1.0``.

1. Add ``django_odesk_auth`` to INSTALLED_APPS.
   Make sure you have ``django.contrib.sites`` app in INSTALLED_APPS as well.

2. Add ``django_odesk_auth.backends.ODeskOAuthBackend``
   to AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS.

3. Specify ``ODESK_OAUTH_KEY`` and ``ODESK_OAUTH_SECRET`` settings
   with your key information.

4. Add your_username@odesk.com to ``ODESK_AUTH_ALLOWED_USERS``,
   and set ``ODESK_AUTH_CREATE_UNKNOWN_USER`` to True.

5. Include ``django_odesk_auth.urls`` in your URL patterns.

6. In your login page template, put a link "Log in via oDesk" and point it
   to ``{% url "odesk_oauth_login" %}``.

7. Open login page and click "Log in via oDesk" to verify everything works.

Important: keep ``ODESK_OAUTH_KEY`` and ``ODESK_OAUTH_SECRET`` settings in a file
that is not under version control.


Example project
---------------

Requirements: Vagrant, Ansible, and free 8000 port.

First, fill in some critical settings in ``example_project/settings.py``
(see comments in the file).

From example_project directory, bring up a VM using provided Vagrantfile
and run Django development server on it:

    $ vagrant up
    $ vagrant ssh
    vm$ cd /vagrant/example_project/
    vm$ ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

On your host machine, navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000 and you should be able
to test Upwork login functionality.


Access control
--------------

App has basic access control facilities.

You can specify who is allowed to log in to your site and who upon login gets
staff and/or superuser statuses. This is configured through Django settings.

Currently access control cannot be turned off.
You **have** to explicitly specify at least who is allowed to log in to your site.
(Yes, this means you can't grant access to everyone yet, unless you hack the app.)

Users that aren't allowed to log in get ``User.is_active`` flag set to False.
See ``utils.update_user_permissions()`` definition if you're interested in other specifics,
and see available settings below.


Making authenticated oDesk API calls
------------------------------------

After user is successfully authenticated, you can call oDesk API on their behalf.

Here's a quick example::

    from django_odesk_auth import utils, O_ACCESS_TOKEN
    
    odesk_client = utils.get_client(request.session[O_ACCESS_TOKEN])
    print odesk_client.hr.get_teams()
    # Should output list of teams user has access to

Some notes:

* How you make API calls is up to you. Internally django-odesk-auth
  uses python-upwork library, and so does this example.

* ``utils.get_client()`` function returns an instance of ``upwork.Client``.
  Handy if you're using python-upwork library to make API calls.

* OAuth access token, obtained during authentication, is stored
  under ``request.session[O_ACCESS_TOKEN]``.


Checking OAuth access token
---------------------------

Sometimes there's a need to make sure that current user's authentication
is still validâ€”that they, for example, didn't revoke access to their account.

For that you can use ``utils.check_login()`` in Python, or make an AJAX request
to named URL ``'odesk_oauth_check_login'`` from client side
(see ``views.oauth_check_login``).


Available Django settings
-------------------------

ODESK_OAUTH_KEY, ODESK_OAUTH_SECRET

ODESK_AUTH_CREATE_UNKNOWN_USER = False  
  Whether to create a new account in Django if given user logs in via oDesk
  for the first time.

ODESK_AUTH_ALLOWED_USERS = ()  
  oDesk emails of users who are allowed to log in via oDesk.

ODESK_AUTH_ADMINS = ()  
  oDesk emails of users who are marked as ``is_staff`` upon login.

ODESK_AUTH_SUPERUSERS = ()  
  oDesk emails of users who are marked as ``is_superuser`` upon login.

ODESK_AUTH_ALLOWED_TEAMS = ()  
  IDs of oDesk teams, members of which are allowed to log in via oDesk.

ODESK_AUTH_ADMIN_TEAMS = ()  
  IDs of oDesk teams, members of which are marked as ``is_staff`` upon login.

ODESK_AUTH_SUPERUSER_TEAMS = ()  
  IDs of oDesk teams, members of which are marked as ``is_superuser`` upon login.
